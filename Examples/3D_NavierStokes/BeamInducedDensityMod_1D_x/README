3D NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS FOR COMPRESSIBLE FLOWS

Non-Dimensionalization:

  See aux/init.C for normalization

  Reynolds number = 146.5
  Prandtl number = 0.671

Domain:

  -2.5 lambda_ac <= x <= 2.5 lambda_ac
  where lambda_ac is the acoustic spatial period
  (see aux/init.C)
  0 <= z <= z_mm

  "extrapolate" boundary conditions along x and z

  y is a "dummy" dimension with periodic BCs 
  since this is a 1D problem

Initial Solution:

    rho  = 1.0
    u    = 0.0
    v    = 0.0
    p    = 1.0/gamma

    (uniform flow)

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters
+ chemistry.inp -   Photo-chemistry parameters
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.C)

** See piafs/README for other (optional) input files

Due to file sizes, the required file initial.inp for 
initial solution are not provided. It can be generated 
by compiling aux/init.C and running the executable in the 
run directory (where solver.inp is present).
