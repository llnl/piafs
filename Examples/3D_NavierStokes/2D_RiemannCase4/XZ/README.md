# 2D Riemann Problem (Case 4) - XZ Plane

## Overview

Simulation of the 2D Riemann problem (Configuration 4) along the XZ plane using the 3D Navier-Stokes solver. This is a classic test case for compressible flow solvers featuring complex wave interactions including shock waves, contact discontinuities, and rarefaction waves. The problem is solved as a 2D problem in the XZ plane, with Y as a dummy dimension.

## Governing Equations

3D Navier-Stokes equations for compressible flows:

```
d   [ rho   ]   d   [   rho*u    ]   d   [   rho*v    ]   d   [   rho*w    ]
--  [ rho*u ] + --  [rho*u*u + p ] + --  [  rho*u*v   ] + --  [  rho*u*w   ] = viscous terms
dt  [ rho*v ]   dx  [  rho*u*v   ]   dy  [rho*v*v + p ] + dz  [  rho*v*w   ]
    [ rho*w ]       [  rho*u*w   ]       [  rho*v*w   ]       [rho*w*w + p ]
    [   e   ]       [  (e+p)*u   ]       [  (e+p)*v   ]       [  (e+p)*w   ]
```

Where:
- `rho` - density
- `u` - x-velocity
- `v` - y-velocity
- `w` - z-velocity
- `p` - pressure
- `e` - total energy

Equation of state:
```
         p         1
e = -------  +   - rho * (u^2 + v^2 + w^2)
    gamma-1      2
```

## Domain and Boundary Conditions

- Domain: `-0.5 <= x, y, z <= 0.5`
- Boundary conditions: Extrapolate on all boundaries
- Y is a dummy dimension since this is effectively a 2D problem in the XZ plane

## Initial Conditions

The 2D Riemann problem consists of four constant states in four quadrants separated by discontinuities at x=0 and z=0. See the reference paper for specific initial values for Case 4.

## Required Input Files

- `solver.inp` - General solver parameters
- `boundary.inp` - Boundary conditions
- `physics.inp` - Physical parameters
- `initial.inp` - Initial solution (generated by `aux/init.C`)

See the main PIAFS README for other optional input files.

## How to Run

1. **Generate the initial solution:**
   ```bash
   cd Examples/3D_NavierStokes/2D_RiemannCase4/XZ
   g++ aux/init.C -o INIT
   ./INIT
   ```

2. **Run the simulation:**
   ```bash
   # Serial mode
   /path/to/piafs/bin/PIAFS-<compiler>-serial solver.inp

   # Parallel mode (e.g., 8 processes)
   mpiexec -n 8 /path/to/piafs/bin/PIAFS-<compiler>-mpi solver.inp
   ```

3. **Visualize results:**
   - If `op_file_format` is set to `text` in `solver.inp`, solution files can be plotted with Gnuplot or any plotting tool
   - Use Python scripts in `Examples/Python/` for binary format output
   - Tecplot users can use the file `solution.lay` to visualize the solution

## Notes

- The code `aux/init.C` generates the initial solution file in the correct format required by the solver
- This test case is useful for validating the shock-capturing capabilities of numerical schemes
- The problem features complex wave interactions typical of multi-dimensional compressible flows
