This folder contains several "ready-to-run" examples for various
number of dimensions and physical models.

Each case has all the required input files. Typically, the initial
solution is not provided, it can be generated by compiling and 
running the provided code (see specific README files in each 
example). 

There are some scheme-specific input files, eg:
  lusolver.inp  -> for any compact finite-difference scheme 
                   (eg. CRWENO, HCWENO)
  weno.inp      -> for any WENO-type scheme (WENO, CRWENO, HCWENO)
These are present in the folders for cases using these schemes, 
and so may not be present in all the folders.
If one wants to run some other case with any of these schemes, the
specific input file can be copied over from a folder where it exists.
In its absence, the scheme will still execute using default parameters.
