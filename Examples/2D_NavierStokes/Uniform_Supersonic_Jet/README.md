# Uniform Supersonic Jet

## Overview

Simulation of a uniform supersonic jet with photo-chemical heating. The jet flows in the vertical (y) direction with supersonic inflow and outflow boundary conditions. This test case demonstrates the solver's capability to handle supersonic jet flows with chemical source terms. The flow is uniform in the x-direction but varies in y.

## Governing Equations

2D Navier-Stokes equations with chemical heating source term:

```
d   [ rho   ]   d   [   rho*u    ]    d  [   rho*v   ]                    [     0       ]
--  [ rho*u ] + --  [rho*u*u + p ] +  -- [  rho*u*v  ] =  viscous terms + [     0       ]
dt  [ rho*v ]   dx  [   rho*u*v  ]    dy [rho*v*v + p]                    [     0       ]
    [   e   ]       [   (e+p)*u  ]       [  (e+p)v   ]                    [ Q/(gamma-1) ]
```

Where:
- `rho` - density
- `u` - x-velocity
- `v` - y-velocity
- `p` - pressure
- `e` - internal energy
- `Q` - heating due to photo-chemical reactions

Equation of state:
```
         p         1
e = -------  +   - rho * (u^2+v^2)
    gamma-1      2
```

## Non-Dimensionalization

See `aux/init.C` for normalization details.

## Domain and Boundary Conditions

- Domain: `-2.5*lambda_ac <= x <= 2.5*lambda_ac` (where `lambda_ac` is the acoustic spatial period, see `aux/init.C`)
- Boundary conditions:
  - Along x: Extrapolate
  - Along y (minimum): Supersonic inflow
  - Along y (maximum): Supersonic outflow

## Initial Conditions

Uniform flow:
- `rho = 1.0`
- `u = 0.0`
- `v = 1.63` (supersonic jet velocity)
- `p = 69.846`

## Required Input Files

- `solver.inp` - General solver parameters
- `boundary.inp` - Boundary conditions
- `physics.inp` - Physical parameters
- `chemistry.inp` - Photo-chemistry parameters
- `initial.inp` - Initial solution (generated by `aux/init.C`)

See the main PIAFS README for other optional input files.

## How to Run

1. **Generate the initial solution:**
   ```bash
   cd Examples/2D_NavierStokes/Uniform_Supersonic_Jet
   g++ aux/init.C -o INIT
   ./INIT
   ```

2. **Run the simulation:**
   ```bash
   # Serial mode
   /path/to/piafs/bin/PIAFS-<compiler>-serial solver.inp

   # Parallel mode (e.g., 8 processes)
   mpiexec -n 8 /path/to/piafs/bin/PIAFS-<compiler>-mpi solver.inp
   ```

3. **Visualize results:**
   - If `op_file_format` is set to `text` in `solver.inp`, solution files can be plotted with Gnuplot or any plotting tool
   - Use Python scripts in `Examples/Python/` for binary format output

## Notes

- The code `aux/init.C` generates the initial solution file in the correct format required by the solver
- The `chemistry.inp` file specifies the photo-chemical reaction parameters
- The jet flows in the y-direction and is uniform in the x-direction
- The flow is supersonic (Mach number > 1)
- Supersonic inflow and outflow boundary conditions are used to handle the high-speed flow
