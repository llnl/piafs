# 2D Riemann Problem (Case 4)

## Overview

Classic 2D Riemann problem for the Euler equations, featuring the interaction of four constant states separated by a cross. This test case produces a complex wave pattern including shocks, contact discontinuities, and expansion fans. Case 4 is one of the standard configurations from Lax and Liu's suite of 2D Riemann problems.

## Governing Equations

2D Euler equations for inviscid, compressible flows:

```
d   [ rho   ]   d   [   rho*u    ]    d  [   rho*v   ]
--  [ rho*u ] + --  [rho*u*u + p ] +  -- [  rho*u*v  ] = 0
dt  [ rho*v ]   dx  [   rho*u*v  ]    dy [rho*v*v + p]
    [   e   ]       [   (e+p)*u  ]       [  (e+p)v   ]
```

Where:
- `rho` - density
- `u` - x-velocity
- `v` - y-velocity
- `p` - pressure
- `e` - internal energy

Equation of state:
```
         p         1
e = -------  +   - rho * (u^2+v^2)
    gamma-1      2
```

## Domain and Boundary Conditions

- Domain: `-0.5 <= x,y <= 0.5`
- Boundary conditions: Extrapolate

## Initial Conditions

The domain is divided into four quadrants, each with a constant state. See `aux/init.C` for the specific values defining each quadrant for Case 4.

## Required Input Files

- `solver.inp` - General solver parameters
- `boundary.inp` - Boundary conditions
- `physics.inp` - Physical parameters
- `initial.inp` - Initial solution (generated by `aux/init.C`)

See the main PIAFS README for other optional input files.

## How to Run

1. **Generate the initial solution:**
   ```bash
   cd Examples/2D_NavierStokes/Riemann2DCase4
   g++ aux/init.C -o INIT
   ./INIT
   ```

2. **Run the simulation:**
   ```bash
   # Serial mode
   /path/to/piafs/bin/PIAFS-<compiler>-serial solver.inp

   # Parallel mode (e.g., 8 processes)
   mpiexec -n 8 /path/to/piafs/bin/PIAFS-<compiler>-mpi solver.inp
   ```

3. **Visualize results:**
   - If `op_file_format` is set to `text` in `solver.inp`, solution files can be plotted with Gnuplot or any plotting tool
   - Use Python scripts in `Examples/Python/` for binary format output
   - Tecplot users can use the file `solution.lay` to visualize the solution

## Notes

- The code `aux/init.C` generates the initial solution file in the correct format required by the solver
- The exact solution file also needs to be in the same format
- This is a challenging test case for numerical schemes due to the complex wave interactions
- The solution exhibits shocks, contact discontinuities, and rarefaction waves emanating from the central cross
