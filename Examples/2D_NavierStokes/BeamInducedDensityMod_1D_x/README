  rho   - density
  u     - x-velocity
  v     - y-velocity
  p     - pressure
  e     - internal energy

  Equation of state:
           p         1
    e = -------  +   - rho * (u^2+v^2)
        gamma-1      2

Here, Q is the heating due to photo-chemical reactions

Non-Dimensionalization:

  See aux/init.C for normalization

Domain:

  -2.5 lambda_ac <= x <= 2.5 lambda_ac
  where lambda_ac is the acoustic spatial period
  (see aux/init.C)

  "extrapolate" boundary conditions along x

  y is a "dummy" dimension with periodic BCs 
  since this is a 1D problem

Initial Solution:

    rho  = 1.0
    u    = 0.0
    v    = 0.0
    p    = 1.0

    (uniform flow)

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters
+ chemistry.inp -   Photo-chemistry parameters
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.C)

** See piafs2d/README for other (optional) input files

Due to file sizes, the required file initial.inp for 
initial solution are not provided. It can be generated 
by compiling aux/init.C and running the executable in the 
run directory (where solver.inp is present).
