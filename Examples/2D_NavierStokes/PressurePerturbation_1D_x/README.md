# Pressure Perturbation (1D in x)

## Overview

Simulation of acoustic wave propagation from an initial Gaussian pressure perturbation. This test case demonstrates the solver's ability to capture acoustic waves in viscous flows. This is a 1D problem (variation in x only) solved using the 2D Navier-Stokes solver with y as a dummy dimension.

## Governing Equations

2D Navier-Stokes equations for compressible flows:

```
d   [ rho   ]   d   [   rho*u    ]    d  [   rho*v   ]
--  [ rho*u ] + --  [rho*u*u + p ] +  -- [  rho*u*v  ] =  viscous terms
dt  [ rho*v ]   dx  [   rho*u*v  ]    dy [rho*v*v + p]
    [   e   ]       [   (e+p)*u  ]       [  (e+p)v   ]
```

Where:
- `rho` - density
- `u` - x-velocity
- `v` - y-velocity
- `p` - pressure
- `e` - internal energy

Equation of state:
```
         p         1
e = -------  +   - rho * (u^2+v^2)
    gamma-1      2
```

## Non-Dimensionalization

See `aux/init.c` for normalization details.

## Domain and Boundary Conditions

- Domain: `-5*lambda_ac <= x <= 5*lambda_ac` (where `lambda_ac` is the acoustic spatial period, see `aux/init.c`)
- Boundary conditions along x: Periodic
- Boundary conditions along y: Periodic (y is a dummy dimension since this is a 1D problem)

## Initial Conditions

```
rho  = 1.0
u    = 0.0
v    = 0.0
p    = 1.0 + dp
```

where the pressure perturbation is a Gaussian:

```
dp = a * exp [ -0.5 * (x/s)^2 ]
s = w / [ 2 sqrt(2 log(2)) ]

a = 1.0    (amplitude)
w = 5.0    (width)
```

## Required Input Files

- `solver.inp` - General solver parameters
- `boundary.inp` - Boundary conditions
- `physics.inp` - Physical parameters
- `initial.inp` - Initial solution (generated by `aux/init.C`)

See the main PIAFS README for other optional input files.

## How to Run

1. **Generate the initial solution:**
   ```bash
   cd Examples/2D_NavierStokes/PressurePerturbation_1D_x
   g++ aux/init.C -o INIT
   ./INIT
   ```

2. **Run the simulation:**
   ```bash
   # Serial mode
   /path/to/piafs/bin/PIAFS-<compiler>-serial solver.inp

   # Parallel mode (e.g., 8 processes)
   mpiexec -n 8 /path/to/piafs/bin/PIAFS-<compiler>-mpi solver.inp
   ```

3. **Visualize results:**
   - If `op_file_format` is set to `text` in `solver.inp`, solution files can be plotted with Gnuplot or any plotting tool
   - Use Python scripts in `Examples/Python/` for binary format output

## Notes

- The code `aux/init.C` generates the initial solution file in the correct format required by the solver
- Although the 2D Navier-Stokes solver is used, this is effectively a 1D problem with variation only in the x-direction
- The initial pressure perturbation propagates as acoustic waves in both directions
- Periodic boundary conditions allow the waves to re-enter the domain
