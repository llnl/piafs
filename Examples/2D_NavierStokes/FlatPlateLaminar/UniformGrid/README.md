# Laminar Flat Plate Boundary Layer

## Overview

Classic benchmark case for validating viscous flow solvers. This simulation computes the laminar boundary layer development over a flat plate with zero pressure gradient. The test case is fundamental in computational fluid dynamics and has well-established theoretical solutions (Blasius solution) for validation.

## Governing Equations

2D Navier-Stokes equations for compressible flows:

```
d   [ rho   ]   d   [   rho*u    ]    d  [   rho*v   ]
--  [ rho*u ] + --  [rho*u*u + p ] +  -- [  rho*u*v  ] =  Viscous terms
dt  [ rho*v ]   dx  [   rho*u*v  ]    dy [rho*v*v + p]
    [   e   ]       [   (e+p)*u  ]       [  (e+p)v   ]
```

Where:
- `rho` - density
- `u` - x-velocity (streamwise)
- `v` - y-velocity (wall-normal)
- `p` - pressure
- `e` - internal energy

Equation of state:
```
         p         1
e = -------  +   - rho * (u^2+v^2)
    gamma-1      2
```

## Physical Parameters

From `physics.inp`:
- `gamma = 1.4` (ratio of specific heats)
- `Pr = 0.72` (Prandtl number)
- `Minf = 0.3` (freestream Mach number)
- `Re = 100000` (Reynolds number)

## Domain and Boundary Conditions

From `boundary.inp`:
- Domain: `-0.25 <= x <= 2.0`, `0.0 <= y <= 0.25`
- Boundary conditions:
  - Left inflow region (x < 0): Subsonic inflow at top, slip wall at bottom
  - Flat plate (0 <= x <= 2.0, y = 0): No-slip wall
  - Top boundary: Subsonic inflow
  - Right boundary: Subsonic outflow
  - Farfield (y = 0.25): Subsonic outflow

## Initial Conditions

Uniform freestream conditions:
- `rho = 1.0`
- `u = 0.3` (corresponding to Mach 0.3)
- `v = 0.0`
- `p = 0.7142857143` (computed from Mach number and gamma)

## Required Input Files

- `solver.inp` - General solver parameters
- `boundary.inp` - Boundary conditions
- `physics.inp` - Physical parameters
- `weno.inp` - WENO scheme parameters
- `initial.inp` - Initial solution (generated by `aux/init.c`)

See the main PIAFS README for other optional input files.

## How to Run

1. **Generate the initial solution:**
   ```bash
   cd Examples/2D_NavierStokes/FlatPlateLaminar/UniformGrid
   gcc aux/init.c -lm -o INIT
   ./INIT
   ```

2. **Run the simulation:**
   ```bash
   # Serial mode
   /path/to/piafs/bin/PIAFS-<compiler>-serial solver.inp

   # Parallel mode (e.g., 8 processes as configured in solver.inp: 2x4)
   mpiexec -n 8 /path/to/piafs/bin/PIAFS-<compiler>-mpi solver.inp
   ```

3. **Visualize results:**
   - If `op_file_format` is set to `text` in `solver.inp`, solution files can be plotted with Gnuplot or any plotting tool
   - Use Python scripts in `Examples/Python/` for binary format output
   - Post-process skin friction using `aux/SkinFriction.c`

## Notes

- The code `aux/init.c` generates the initial solution file in the correct format required by the solver
- The grid is uniform (226 x 502 points) as specified in `solver.inp`
- A slip-wall boundary condition is used upstream of the plate to avoid boundary layer development before the leading edge
- The solution can be validated against the Blasius boundary layer theory
- The `aux/SkinFriction.c` code can be used to compute skin friction coefficient along the plate for comparison with theory
- The simulation uses WENO5 for spatial discretization with a 4th order Runge-Kutta time integration scheme
