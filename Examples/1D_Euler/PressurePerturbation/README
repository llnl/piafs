1D EULER EQUATIONS FOR INVISCID, COMPRESSIBLE FLOWS

  d   [ rho   ]   d   [   rho*u    ]
  --  [ rho*u ] + --  [rho*u*u + p ] = 0
  dt  [   e   ]   dx  [ (e+p)*u    ]

  rho   - density
  u     - velocity
  p     - pressure
  e     - internal energy

  Equation of state:
           p         1
    e = -------  +   - rho * u^2
        gamma-1      2


Non-Dimensionalization:

    L_ref = 1e-6 meters (1 micrometer)
    t_ref = 1e-9 seconds (1 nanosecond)
    rho_ref = 1.225 kg m^{-3}

  Consequently,
    v_ref = L_ref / t_ref = 1e3 m/s
    p_ref = rho_ref*v_ref^2 = 1.225e6 kg m^{-2}  `

Domain:

  lambda_ac = 42.0; (42 micrometers)
  -5 lambda_ac <= x <= 5 lambda_ac
  "periodic" boundary conditions

Initial Solution:

    rho  = 1.0
    u    = 0.0
    p    = p0 + dp

    where p0 = p/p_ref = 101325 Pa / p_ref = 0.082714

  where
    dp = a * exp [ -0.5 * (x/s)*(x/s) ] 
    s = w / [ 2 sqrt{2 log(2)} ]

    a = 1.0*p0
    w = 5.0

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.c)

** See piafs2d/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver.
