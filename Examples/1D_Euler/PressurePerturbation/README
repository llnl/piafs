1D EULER EQUATIONS FOR INVISCID, COMPRESSIBLE FLOWS

  d   [ rho   ]   d   [   rho*u    ]
  --  [ rho*u ] + --  [rho*u*u + p ] = 0
  dt  [   e   ]   dx  [ (e+p)*u    ]

  rho   - density
  u     - velocity
  p     - pressure
  e     - internal energy

  Equation of state:
           p         1
    e = -------  +   - rho * u^2
        gamma-1      2


Non-Dimensionalization:

  See aux/init.c for normalization

Domain:

  -5 lambda_ac <= x <= 5 lambda_ac
  where lambda_ac is the acoustic spatial period
  (see aux/init.c)

  "periodic" boundary conditions

Initial Solution:

    rho  = 1.0
    u    = 0.0
    p    = 1.0 + dp

  where
    dp = a * exp [ -0.5 * (x/s)*(x/s) ] 
    s = w / [ 2 sqrt{2 log(2)} ]

    a = 1.0
    w = 5.0

The following input files are required:
+ solver.inp    -   General solver parameters
+ boundary.inp  -   Boundary conditions
+ physics.inp   -   Physical parameters (advection speed)
+ initial.inp   -   Initial solution
                    (can be generated by aux/init.c)

** See piafs2d/README for other (optional) input files

Notes:-
The code aux/init.c is an example to generate the initial
solution file in the correct format required by the solver.
