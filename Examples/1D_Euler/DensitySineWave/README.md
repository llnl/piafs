# Density Wave Advection

## Overview

Test case for advection of a sinusoidal density perturbation in a uniform flow. This problem has an exact analytical solution and is commonly used to verify the accuracy of numerical schemes.

## Governing Equations

1D Euler equations for inviscid, compressible flows:

```
d   [ rho   ]   d   [   rho*u    ]
--  [ rho*u ] + --  [rho*u*u + p ] = 0
dt  [   e   ]   dx  [ (e+p)*u    ]
```

Where:
- `rho` - density
- `u` - velocity
- `p` - pressure
- `e` - internal energy

Equation of state:
```
         p         1
e = -------  +   - rho * u^2
    gamma-1      2
```

## Domain and Boundary Conditions

- Domain: `0 <= x < 1.0`
- Boundary conditions: Periodic

## Exact Solution

The density wave advects with the flow velocity:

```
rho = 1.0 + 0.1*sin(2*pi*(x-t))
u   = 1.0
p   = 1.0/gamma
```

Time period: `1.0`

## Required Input Files

- `solver.inp` - General solver parameters
- `boundary.inp` - Boundary conditions
- `physics.inp` - Physical parameters
- `initial.inp` - Initial solution (generated by `aux/exact.c`)
- `exact.inp` - Exact solution (optional, used to compute error; generated by `aux/exact.c`)

See the main PIAFS README for other optional input files.

## How to Run

1. **Generate the initial and exact solutions:**
   ```bash
   cd Examples/1D_Euler/DensitySineWave
   gcc aux/exact.c -lm -o EXACT
   ./EXACT
   ```

2. **Run the simulation:**
   ```bash
   # Serial mode
   /path/to/piafs/bin/PIAFS-<compiler>-serial solver.inp

   # Parallel mode (e.g., 4 processes)
   mpiexec -n 4 /path/to/piafs/bin/PIAFS-<compiler>-mpi solver.inp
   ```

3. **Visualize results:**
   - If `op_file_format` is set to `text` in `solver.inp`, solution files can be plotted with Gnuplot or any plotting tool
   - Use Python scripts in `Examples/Python/` for binary format output

## Notes

- The code `aux/exact.c` generates both the initial and exact solution files in the correct format
- This test case is ideal for accuracy studies since the exact solution is known at all times
