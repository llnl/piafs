Getting Started
===============

Welcome to PIAFS! This section will help you get up and running quickly.

PIAFS is a finite-difference code for solving compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations on Cartesian grids. It supports MPI parallelization, GPU acceleration, and includes a photochemistry module for laser-induced heating simulations.

What You'll Learn
-----------------

In this section, you'll learn how to:

* Install and build PIAFS on your system
* Understand the basic concepts and workflow
* Run an example simulation with photochemistry
* Visualize the results

Prerequisites
-------------

Before getting started with PIAFS, you should have:

* Basic knowledge of computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
* Familiarity with the command line/terminal
* A C/C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or Intel)
* MPI library (for parallel runs)
* Optional: CUDA or HIP for GPU acceleration

Next Steps
----------

1. :doc:`installation` - Install PIAFS and its dependencies
2. :doc:`quick-start` - Quick overview of PIAFS workflow
3. :doc:`first-simulation` - Run an example PIAFS simulation
